    content: 'Throne of Glass was the book that introduced me to the world of fantasy, and I could not think of a better first entrance.\nCelaena Sardothien is one of the coolest characters I have ever read about, and reading the detail of how her mind works as an assassin makes the book from the first page something I struggled to put down.',
    summary: "After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. \n\nHer opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she will serve the kingdom for three years and then be granted her freedom. \n\nCelaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilirating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best. Then one of the other contestants turns up dead... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.",
